# **KOKKU DEV TEST**

**Modifications**

Jo√£o Fortunato Jr.

- First, I fixed a compilation error, the line responsible for adding a new tile to the grid was being called from the wrong place in the Grid class.
- The next step was to refactor the code, starting with the naming of variables and functions following Microsoft Coding Conventions.
- Explicit access modifiers.
- I removed two classes that were in the root of the project, but that were not being used for anything and were expendable.
- It was set to choose the enemy randomly only from 1 to 3, and it should be from 1 to 4, so I fixed it.
- The board size was hard coded.
- The game was not asking for grid size.
- I added input validation.
- I replaced the grid List with a matrix to make it easier to deal with and leaner.
- Removed references to libraries that are not used
- Player and enemy starting tile were not random.
- Character position variable was passed to Character class instead of Program.
- Rewrote the way to detect the character's action, both attack and movement.
- Classes were created for each character class, instead of just one enum.
